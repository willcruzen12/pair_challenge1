Koala Holla
===========

Our client, Koala Holla (1976 Llama Comma Drive, Walla Walla WA) is a non-profit dedicated to the ethical transitioning of koalas from the outdoors (whereupon they may be rained) to urban areas where roofs exist. Your team has been hired build a web app to handle their terrarium residents.

Technologies
------------
* JQuery
* Node
* Express
* SQL

Client needs
------------
Koala Holla has provided a CSV (comma separated values) spreadsheet of their current inventory. They want a database that houses this information, is able to be viewed at any time, and has the ability to update data as needed.

They have also provided their logo and the source code from when Lou (a KH employee) tried to spin up a JEN stack project to support this, but had to leave for foraging school in Finland before he could finally finish.

Delivery
--------
Upon completion of the project you'll need to provide not only the source (via github url), but also instructions on how the database and its table(s) should be set up. This can be in a simple databaseSetup.txt file in the repo.
